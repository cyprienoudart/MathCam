# PhotoMath
## 📱 Overview
PhotoMath is a powerful iOS application that allows users to solve mathematical problems by simply taking a photo. Built with SwiftUI and AVFoundation, this app brings the convenience of optical character recognition (OCR) to mathematics, making problem-solving faster and more intuitive.

## ✨ Features
### 📸 Camera Integration
- Real-time camera preview with frame guides
- Photo capture functionality for math problems
- Optimized image processing for text recognition
### 🧮 Built-in Calculator
- Comprehensive mathematical operations
- Support for basic arithmetic: +, -, ×, ÷
- Advanced functions: trigonometry, logarithms, calculus symbols
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls
### 📋 Menu System
- Language selection (currently English)
- Settings configuration
- Help center access
- About information
- Premium features (PhotoMath Plus)
## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
